# ThreadExample
small project showing threads under execution

************* just run the main class

***** it's a small thread demo to show that the os organizes threads execution

**** you enter a number >0 to print from 0 to that number in main thread and a created thread

**** if you enter number<0 then the program will exit 

that's all :)
